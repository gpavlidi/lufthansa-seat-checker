# lufthansa-seat-checker
Cronnable script that checks your Lufthansa reservation seat numbers, and notifies you if they re not the expected.

## Why?
After realising (a day before my flight) that my months-ago assigned (and payed) seats are gone, I decided to closely monitor the seat assignment, especially since this has happened to me twice in two separate flights.
